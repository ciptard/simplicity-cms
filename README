What the hell is this?

This is a very simple CMS made with javascript and php for those times when you are making a really dumb page and you don't want the client to be calling you every 5 minutes for every little content change.

The setup is too simple: 

1. create a php table in your sql database as follows

content{
	id int(255)
	field varchar(200)
	contentValue varchar(9999)
	last_updated timestamp
}

2. Drop the javascript reference at the bottom of your page
<script type="text/javascript" src="simplicity-cms.js"/>

3. add attribute rel='cms' to any text field you would like to be editable and a unique id.

4. for each editable tag, add the unique id as a key to the content table in db

THATS ALL FOR NOW

I aim to cut these steps down where possible and am welcome to suggestions
